The base text mesh now renders on a flat, orthogonal surface without perspective transform.\n\nAnalysis results:\n1. Verified perspective transform was applied to the base text mesh via rotateX (10°), rotateY (-2°), rotateZ (4°) in computeCameraVertices\n2. Determined that with glow/bloom effects removed, the base text mesh should be flat\n3. Confirmed transform matrix calculation was working correctly; rotations were simply locked to 0\n\nChanges:\n- Set rotateX, rotateY, rotateZ parameters to 0 (was 10, -2, 4)\n- Commented out rotation slider bindings in debug UI to indicate they're locked\n- Scale, translate, and origin parameters remain functional for future adjustments\n\nCommit: a7bc56e0bed47230d5c77c9102d88693716ec9b3 fix(spinner-verbs-generator-b9o): remove rotation distortion from text mesh projection","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","assignee":"spinner-verbs-generator-b9o-agent","owner":"jurrejan@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-11T12:40:49.25075+07:00","created_by":"jurrejan","updated_at":"2026-02-11T14:33:35.345091+07:00","closed_at":"2026-02-11T14:33:35.345096+07:00"}

Documented resolution multiplier impact (0.25 at 2x DPR = 0.5 native resolution) which reduces overhead while maintaining text quality via SimpleMesh camera projection.\n\nCommit: 7f96aedb4df729efdc31772ac16abf056a8088b7 fix(spinner-verbs-generator-mts): optimize PixiJS layers for native rendering path","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"bug","assignee":"spinner-verbs-generator-mts-agent","owner":"jurrejan@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-11T12:40:56.365543+07:00","created_by":"jurrejan","updated_at":"2026-02-11T14:31:35.789228+07:00","closed_at":"2026-02-11T14:31:35.78923+07:00"}
